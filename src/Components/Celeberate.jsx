        Halloween is celebrated with costumes, decorations, and parties in many
        parts of the world. People dress up as spooky characters like ghosts,
        witches, or popular culture icons. Children often go "trick-or-treating"
        from door to door, collecting candies and treats. Homes are decorated
        with jack-oâ€™-lanterns, cobwebs, and spooky lights. Some attend themed
        events or haunted houses, while others gather around bonfires or watch
        horror movies. The holiday provides a fun, festive way for people of all
        ages to embrace the spooky, playful spirit of Halloween.
